UBC Women in Data Science x SAP Case Competition
- In the rapidly evolving tech industry, businesses are increasingly turning to
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline operations, improve decision-making,
and foster innovation. SAP, a global leader in business process software,
stands at the forefront of this transformation, leveraging AI to redefine
enterprise software solutions
- In this project , we propose methods for integrating artificial intelligence into SAPâ€™s business
processes to improve efficiency and overall value to customers.
- The method for this is to conduct a predictive modeling (logistic regression) to see which factors affect customer churn the most.
Then suggest recommenedations for SAP how to intergrate AI to decrease customer churn based on those predictions.
